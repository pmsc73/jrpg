Picking this back up. Many reworkings coming down the pipeline.

#Battle Log
Implementing a bestiary of sorts, which will include damage and kills done to each type of enemy.
This will enable store/ability features that are coming.

For example:
Kill 10 _Thugs_ --> Deal 0.1% extra damage to _Thugs_

A scalable version of such an unlockable could look like
*task* *amount* *target* --> Deal *percent*/*static* extra damage to *target*
*task* *amount* *target* --> Gain +1 AP
_*COST*_ AP --> Gain 0.01 AP per _target_ kill
